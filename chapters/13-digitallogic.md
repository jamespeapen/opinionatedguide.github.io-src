# Chapter 13 - Digital Logic

## What is digital logic?

ignoring the analog world (10%/90%)

### Truth Tables, K-Maps

min/max terms, Don't cares

## Basic Logic Gates

#### Not

Truth table, transistor implimentation, cost, power consumption at switch

#### And, Nand

#### Or, Nor, Exnor

### Xor, Exor

#### Transmission,

#### Mux, Demux

## Basic combonational logic

propogation delay, fan in/out

### 2's Compliment, Adders

overflow, carry, 

## Latches and Flip Flops

SR, Dl, Dff, Tff, JKff,

### Registers

### Counters

## More Digital Logic resources

We'll come back to look at more complex digital logic in ****chapter 28 "Let's try out programmable logic"**** and **29 "Let's make our own SOC"** , but if you're hungry for even more, here are some resources
