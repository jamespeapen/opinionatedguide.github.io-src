[Todo, insert intro about Minecraft redstone]

## What is digital logic?

ignoring the analog world (10%/90%)

### Truth Tables, K-Maps

min/max terms, Don't cares, SOP/POS, multiple out

## Basic Logic Gates

#### Not

Truth table, transistor implementation pmos/nmos, cost, power consumption at switch

#### And, Nand

#### Or, Nor, Exnor

### Xor, Exor

#### Transmission,

#### Mux, Demux, encoders

## Basic combinational logic

propagation delay, fan in/out, POS/POS 

### 2's Compliment, Floating Pt, Math

overflow, carry, ripple, fast, mul, shift-and-add mult, divider,

## Latches and Flip Flops

SR, Dl, edge triggering, Dff, Tff, JKff,

### Registers

### Counters

## More Digital Logic resources

We'll come back to look at more complex digital logic in chapter 28 "Let's try out programmable logic" and **29 "Let's make our own SOC"** , but if you're hungry for even more, here are some resources
